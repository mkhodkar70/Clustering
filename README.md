# Clustering
Unsupervised Learning -- Hierarchical Clustering, k-means Algorithm, PCA, etc.

1) Footwear Product Segmentation (Product_Segmentation): <br>
Hierarchical and k-means clustering techniques have been leveraged to cluster several thousands of Nike and Adidas products 
into a handful of segments, based on attributes such as listing price, sale price, discount and rating. Distinctive features
of different clusters have then been compared against each other using cluster profiling. <br>
Key tools: K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, Segmentation, Cluster Profiling <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, scipy.cluster, yellowbrick, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas

2) RNA Sequencing Analysis of Cancer Tumors (Gene_Analysis): <br>
The gene expression data provided by RNA sequencing has been transformed into a much lower-dimensional space utilizing Principal
Component Analysis so that at least 80% of the variance is retained. The results of PCA have then been contrasted against those of 
the visualization/clustering technique known as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. <br>
Key tools: Dimensionality Recuction, Reduced-Order Modeling, Principal Component Analysis, t-SNE Clustering <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, numpy.linalg, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas


3) Stock Segmentation for an Investment Management Firm (Stock_Clustering): <br>
In order to devise personalized investment strategies for clients, an asset management firm has provided the stock data of a
wide variety of companies present on NYSE, and has requested an ML-based solution for grouping of the stocks into distinct and 
interpretable clusters, using their attributes such current price, price change, volatility index, cash ratio, cash flow and
P/E ratio. <br>
Key tools: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Cluster Profiling <br>
Libraries: scikit-learn, scipy.cluster, yellowbrick, matplotlib, seaporn, numpy, pandas
